# Steps to Complete: Implement Database Schema

This document provides a concise summary of the steps needed to complete the task "3. Implement Database Schema" as
requested.

## 1. Execute SQL Schema in Supabase SQL Editor

1. Log in to your Supabase account
2. Select your FormCoach project
3. Navigate to the SQL Editor (left sidebar)
4. Click "New Query" to create a new SQL script
5. Copy and paste the SQL code from
   the [SUPABASE_DATABASE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](SUPABASE_DATABASE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) file
6. Execute the SQL code in sections:
    - First run the core tables creation script
    - Then run the RLS policies script
    - Finally run the database triggers script

## 2. Create Core Tables

The following core tables will be created:

- `profiles`: User profiles extending Supabase auth.users
- `exercises`: Exercise library with descriptions and metadata
- `workout_plans`: User-created workout plans
- `workout_plan_exercises`: Exercises included in workout plans
- `workout_sessions`: Records of completed workouts
- `exercise_logs`: Details of exercises performed in sessions
- `form_analyses`: AI analysis of exercise form
- `progress_metrics`: User progress tracking

## 3. Implement and Test RLS Policies

Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure that users can only access their own data:

1. Each table has RLS enabled with appropriate policies
2. Users can only view, create, update, and delete their own data
3. The exercises table has public read access but restricted write access

To test the RLS policies:

1. Create a test user through the Supabase Auth UI or API
2. Use the SQL Editor to run the test queries provided in the implementation guide
3. Verify that users can only access their own data

## Verification

After implementation, verify the schema by:

1. Going to the "Table Editor" in the Supabase dashboard
2. Checking that all tables are created with the correct columns
3. Clicking on "Policies" for each table to verify RLS policies are in place
