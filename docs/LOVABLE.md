### Option 2: Edit in Your IDE (PyCharm, Windsurf, VS Code)

**Steps:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cintegras/formcoach.git
cd formcoach
cd frontend
npm install

Style Prompt
Based on my review of the code and the FormCoach concept, I have several suggestions to enhance your application design and user experience:

Consistent Design Across Auth Pages: The signup page has a translucent teal background (rgba(176, 232, 227, 0.12)) which better aligns with your FormCoach brand identity, while the login and forgot password pages use a solid black background. I'd recommend using the signup page's translucent teal background for all auth pages for consistency.
Visual Elements for Health & Wellness: Consider adding subtle visual elements that reinforce the "calm, safety, and balance" aspects of your brand. For example:
Subtle wave patterns or gradient overlays in teal
Simple iconic elements that represent balance or form (like minimalist posture guides)
Breathing animation cues for form pages (subtly pulsing teal elements)
Accessibility Enhancements: Given your target audience may include users with injuries or chronic conditions:
Increase contrast for important text elements
Add subtle form validation animations rather than just error text
Consider input field animations that feel "supportive" rather than "corrective"
Progressive Onboarding: Since your platform emphasizes adaptability and personalization:
Add a brief progress indicator for the signup/onboarding flow
Include supportive microcopy that aligns with the "coach" persona
Custom Input Fields: Your unique approach deserves custom form elements:
Design form inputs with teal focus states and subtle animations
Consider checkbox and selection controls that feel more "wellness-oriented"
Add icon support to all form fields (like the Mail icon in ForgotPassword.tsx)
Logo Integration: If you have a FormCoach logo, consider incorporating it in the auth pages for stronger brand presence.
Button Enhancement: Your square buttons with the teal color already look great, but consider:
Adding subtle loading animations that feel "balanced" rather than just spinners
Using slightly different button styles for primary vs secondary actions
Update Login.tsx and ForgotPassword.tsx to use the translucent teal background from Signup.tsx
Add consistent icon support across all form fields (currently only in ForgotPassword)
Create subtle animations for form interactions using the existing tailwind animation classes
Enhance button states with subtle feedback animations
Update text colors to leverage the formcoach color palette from tailwind.config.ts
Add subtle visual elements that reinforce the wellness/coaching brand identity
