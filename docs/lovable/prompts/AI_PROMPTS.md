## Implementation Example

When implementing AI recommendations in FormCoach:

```tsx
const handleAIFormAnalysis = async (formData) => {
  // Construct the prompt
  const prompt = `
    Analyze the following exercise form and provide feedback:
    - Exercise: ${formData.exercise}
    - User description: ${formData.description}
    - Pain points: ${formData.painPoints}
    
    Provide specific recommendations for:
    1. Form corrections
    2. Common mistakes to avoid
    3. Suggested modifications if needed
  `;
  
  // Send to AI service
  const response = await aiService.getFormAnalysis(prompt);
  
  // Display the results to the user
  setAnalysisResults(response.analysis);
};
```
