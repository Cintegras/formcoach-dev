This guide helps you resolve common issues when working with FormCoach in Lovable.

## Common Build Errors

### 1. Type Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Red error messages about type mismatches
- Build failures with TypeScript errors

**Solutions:**
- Check for proper type definitions in component props
- Verify that imported types match their usage
- Add proper type annotations to variables and functions

### 2. Component Rendering Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Blank screens
- Components not displaying as expected
- Console errors about rendering

**Solutions:**
- Check for conditional rendering logic
- Verify that data is available before rendering
- Look for missing key props in list rendering
- Check for proper closing tags in JSX

### 3. Styling Problems

**Symptoms:**
- Misaligned UI elements
- Inconsistent colors or spacing
- Mobile responsiveness issues

**Solutions:**
- Verify Tailwind classes are applied correctly
- Check for conflicting styles
- Use responsive utility classes (sm:, md:, lg:)
- Inspect element hierarchy for unexpected wrappers

## Debugging Techniques

### Console Logging

Add strategic console logs to trace data flow:

```tsx
console.log('User data:', userData);
```

### React DevTools

Use React DevTools browser extension to:
- Inspect component props
- Monitor state changes
- Track component re-renders

### Network Debugging

For API or resource loading issues:
- Check browser Network tab
- Verify correct URLs and endpoints
- Look for CORS or authentication errors

## Error Recovery

If you encounter persistent errors:

1. **Revert to Last Working Version**
   - In Lovable, find the last working edit in history
   - Click "Restore" to revert to that version

2. **Isolate Components**
   - Comment out problematic sections
   - Add components back one by one

3. **Clean Project Cache**
   - Clear browser cache and storage
   - Restart the Lovable development server
