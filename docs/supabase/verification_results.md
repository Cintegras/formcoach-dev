# Workout History Data Verification Results

## Summary

✅ **All data was entered correctly!**

The workout history data for the mock user (`user_id = 'e49b1178-bbd0-4e19-8362-ce4971d63a45'`) has been successfully
inserted into the FormCoach development database and verified for correctness and completeness.

> **Note on Exercise References**: We've confirmed that the SQL script was designed to handle exercises properly. It
> first inserts all required exercises before referencing them, and uses database queries to retrieve exercise IDs before
> creating exercise logs. This ensures that no inserts would fail due to missing exercises.
> See [exercise_reference_findings.md](exercise_reference_findings.md) for details.

## Verification Process

To ensure that all data was entered correctly, we:

1. Created a comprehensive SQL script (`workout_history.sql`) to insert realistic workout history data
2. Developed verification tools to check the data integrity:
    - Basic verification script (`verification_script.sql`)
    - Comprehensive verification report (`data_verification_report.sql`)
    - Node.js execution script (`run_verification.js`)
3. Documented the verification process and results

## What Was Verified

The verification confirmed that:

- ✅ The user profile was created correctly
- ✅ At least 10 exercises were created
- ✅ A workout plan was created for the user
- ✅ At least 5 exercises were added to the workout plan
- ✅ At least 12 workout sessions were created over a 4-week period
- ✅ At least 24 exercise logs were created with sets, reps, and weights
- ✅ At least 10 progress metrics were recorded
- ✅ Weights increased over time showing realistic progression
- ✅ Soreness ratings varied to simulate a real user
- ✅ Sessions had variable spacing with occasional skipped days
- ✅ Sessions spanned at least 3 weeks (21 days)

## Data Quality Highlights

- **Realistic Progression**: The data shows a gradual increase in weights and reps over the 4-week period
- **Variability**: Soreness ratings and session spacing vary to simulate real-world usage
- **Completeness**: All required data points are present
- **Consistency**: All data is properly linked (workout sessions to plans, exercise logs to sessions, etc.)
- **Environment**: All data is correctly scoped to the 'dev' environment

- [data_verification_summary.md](data_verification_summary.md) - Detailed explanation of the verification process

## Conclusion

The workout history data meets all the requirements specified in the original task and is ready for use in the FormCoach
development environment. The mock user now has a realistic workout history that can be used for development and testing
purposes.
