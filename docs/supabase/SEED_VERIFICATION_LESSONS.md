# Seed Script Verification Lessons

## Key Failure Identified

After analyzing both the `seed-dev.ts` and `temp-seed.mjs` scripts, a critical potential failure point has been
identified: **incomplete verification chains**.

Both scripts currently implement a robust verification process after each data creation step, but this pattern must be
maintained in all future seed scripts to ensure data integrity and proper environment isolation.

## The Verification Chain

The verification chain in both scripts consists of several critical components:

1. **Environment Filtering**: Using the `withEnvironmentFilter` utility to ensure all database operations are scoped to
   the current environment
2. **Pre-Creation Verification**: Checking if entities already exist before attempting to create them
3. **Post-Creation Verification**: Confirming that all entities were successfully created after the creation step
4. **Relationship Verification**: Ensuring that relationships between entities (e.g., exercises in a workout plan) are
   properly established

## How This Applies to Both Files

Both `seed-dev.ts` (TypeScript) and `temp-seed.mjs` (JavaScript ES Modules) implement the same verification pattern:

```typescript
// Example from both files - Creating exercises
async function createExercises() {
    // ... creation code ...

    // Verify all exercises were created successfully
    console.log('\nVerifying all exercises were created successfully...');
    const {data: allExercises, error: verifyError} = await withEnvironmentFilter(
        supabase.from('exercises').select('id, name').in('name', exerciseNames)
    );

    if (verifyError) {
        throw new Error(`Failed to verify exercises: ${verifyError.message}`);
    }

    if (!allExercises || allExercises.length !== exerciseNames.length) {
        const createdNames = allExercises ? allExercises.map(e => e.name) : [];
        const missingNames = exerciseNames.filter(name => !createdNames.includes(name));
        throw new Error(`Not all exercises were created. Missing: ${missingNames.join(', ')}`);
    }

    console.log(`✓ All ${allExercises.length} exercises verified successfully`);

    // ... return exerciseIds ...
}
```

This pattern is repeated for each entity type (profiles, exercises, workout plans, workout sessions) in both files.

## Why Future Seed Scripts Must Include the Full Verification Chain

Future versions of any seed scripts—whether written in TypeScript (`.ts`) or JavaScript ES Modules (`.mjs`)—must always
include the full verification chain for the following reasons:

1. **Data Integrity**: Without verification, there's no guarantee that the seeding process completed successfully, which
   could lead to incomplete or corrupted test data.

2. **Environment Isolation**: The `withEnvironmentFilter` is crucial for maintaining separation between environments.
   Without it, seed data could leak between environments or be created in the wrong environment.

3. **Dependency Management**: Entities in the system have dependencies (e.g., workout plans depend on exercises).
   Without verification, dependent entities might reference non-existent entities.

4. **Error Detection**: The verification chain helps detect and diagnose errors early in the seeding process, making it
   easier to fix issues.

5. **Idempotency**: The verification process helps make the seed scripts idempotent (can be run multiple times without
   side effects), which is essential for development and testing.

## Implementation Requirements for All Seed Scripts

All future seed scripts must:

1. **Use Environment Filtering**: Always use the `withEnvironmentFilter` utility for all database queries to ensure
   proper environment scoping.

2. **Verify Before Creation**: Check if entities already exist before attempting to create them to avoid duplicates.

3. **Verify After Creation**: Always confirm that entities were successfully created by querying the database after
   creation.

4. **Verify Relationships**: Ensure that relationships between entities are properly established.

5. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Implement proper error handling to provide clear error messages and prevent partial
   seeding.

## Conclusion

The verification chain is not optional—it's a critical component of the seeding process that ensures data integrity,
environment isolation, and proper error handling. All future seed scripts must maintain this pattern to avoid potential
failures and ensure a reliable development and testing environment.
