# Workout History Data Verification Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the verification process for the workout history data that was inserted into the FormCoach
development database. The verification ensures that all required data was properly entered for the mock user (
`user_id = 'e49b1178-bbd0-4e19-8362-ce4971d63a45'`).

## Verification Process

We created two SQL scripts to verify the data:

1. **verification_script.sql**: A basic verification script that checks for the existence of required data.
2. **data_verification_report.sql**: A comprehensive verification script that generates a detailed report on data
   quality.

Additionally, we created a Node.js script (`run_verification.js`) that can execute the verification SQL and display the
results.

## Verification Checks

The verification process includes the following checks:

| Check                  | Description                                           | Requirement                             |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| User Profile           | Verifies that the mock user profile exists            | At least 1 profile                      |
| Exercises              | Checks if the required exercises were created         | At least 10 exercises                   |
| Workout Plan           | Verifies that a workout plan exists for the user      | At least 1 plan                         |
| Workout Plan Exercises | Checks if exercises were added to the workout plan    | At least 5 exercises in plan            |
| Workout Sessions       | Verifies that workout sessions were created           | At least 12 sessions                    |
| Exercise Logs          | Checks if exercise logs were created for the sessions | At least 24 logs                        |
| Progress Metrics       | Verifies that progress metrics were recorded          | At least 10 metrics                     |
| Weight Progression     | Checks if weights increased over time                 | At least 1 exercise showing progression |
| Soreness Variability   | Verifies that soreness ratings vary                   | At least 2 different ratings            |
| Session Spacing        | Checks if sessions have variable spacing              | At least 2 different intervals          |
| Time Period Coverage   | Verifies that sessions span at least 3 weeks          | At least 21 days coverage               |

## How to Run the Verification

### Option 1: Using the SQL Script Directly

1. Open your PostgreSQL client (e.g., pgAdmin, PyCharm Database tool)
2. Connect to your FormCoach development database
3. Open and execute the `data_verification_report.sql` script
4. Review the results in the query output

### Option 2: Using the Node.js Script

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Make sure your `.env` file contains the `DATABASE_URL` variable
3. Run the script with:
   ```
   node run_verification.js
   ```
4. Review the output in the console

## Interpreting the Results

The verification report will show:

- **PASS**: The check was successful, and the data meets the requirements
- **FAIL**: The check failed, and the data does not meet the requirements

For each check, detailed information is provided about what was found in the database.

The overall verification result will indicate if all checks passed or if some checks failed.

## Troubleshooting

If any checks fail, you may need to:

1. Check if the workout_history.sql script was executed successfully
2. Verify that you're connecting to the correct database
3. Ensure that the environment is set to 'dev'
4. Check for any error messages during the SQL execution

## Conclusion

If all checks pass, it confirms that the workout history data was entered correctly and meets all the requirements
specified in the original task. The mock user now has a realistic workout history that can be used for development and
testing purposes.
